### Key Features

- **Typing Practice Gameplay**

  - Enter English or programming sentences within a time limit
  - Correct input = player attacks, mistakes or timeout = monster attacks

- **Difficulty & Battle System**

  - Difficulty affects monster types, spawn rates, item drops, and boss patterns
  - Three monster types (Ghost, Skeleton, Rabbit), each with unique stats and skills
  - Boss battle combines movement, jumping, shooting, and problem-solving

- **Items & Stat Growth**

  - Defeated monsters drop one of five random reward boxes
  - Rewards enhance stats such as life, attack, and defense

- **Game Interface & Animation**
  - Visual effects for attacks, damage, death, rewards, status window, timer, etc.
  - Real-time feedback for correct and incorrect typing

### Role

- **Full Game Design & Implementation**
  - Console screen control with ASCII art
  - Monster/boss logic and difficulty system design
  - Implementation of player stats, item drops, and combat interactions

### Project Reflection

- My first university project; it took time to adapt to console screen control and ASCII graphics
- Tried to implement all initial ideas, though some were limited by language/ASCII constraints
- Wrote over 4,300 lines of code—the longest I’ve ever written—and felt great satisfaction solving problems
- Gained clearer awareness of what I can and cannot do, which significantly improved my implementation skills
